# Multi Cloud Network Segments

## Introduction

This challenge was submitted by Dave Lusty.

There are various clustering technologies which require a single network segment to work. In traditional on-premises solutions customers can use network switches, stretched VLANs and NVGRE to achieve this. Between clouds this will present more of a challenge.

## Instructions

You are aiming to create a single network segment between two clouds (one of them should be Azure!). To test this, you should be able to communicate between two nodes with one on each cloud. The devices should not require routing to achieve this goal.
