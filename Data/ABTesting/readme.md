# A/B Testing

## Introduction

This challenge was submitted by Dave Lusty.

We often talk to customers about A/B testing for marketing purposes, and how we can make two versions of a campaign live and "use the logs" to determine which is more successful.
This has an enormous number of real world applications but the primary one would be in marketing to maximise click through or purchases. The most basic version of this would be the "who's hotter?" site demonstrated on The Social Network film.

To complete this challenge you'll need to create two versions of a site (keep it basic HTML to save time) and use any means you can to collect information about users. This could be based on web logs, a "hidden pixel" sending data to Event Hubs, or some other cool idea you may have.

## Instructions

You need to create two versions of a web site where people will make a choice. Visualise the results and determine which is the more appealing version. How you achieve this is up to you!
