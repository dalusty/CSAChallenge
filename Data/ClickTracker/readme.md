# Click Tracker

## Introduction

This challenge was submitted by Dave Lusty.

Email campaigns are very common these days. It is often useful to track who has viewed the email and then who clicked on the email and visited your link. There are various ways to achieve this, such as images with custom names (GUID?), custom urls, routing engines, and many more which you may be able to imagine for yourself.
At the end of this challenge you should be able to automatically produce a dataset showing who viewed the email, who clicked through, and when those things happened so that in the future we can fine tune when the emails are sent to each user.
