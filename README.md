# CSA Challenge

## Introduction

Welcome to CSA Challenge! Here you will find a set of challenges for cloud solution architects, along with (optional) solutions. You can use these challenges as part of your learning path to gain new skills or practice existing ones.

## Challenges

Each challenge will include a description of an outcome, along with some information about what needs to be achieved, why, and real world use-cases that may need this solution. You will then need to think up a way to solve this challenge and implement it. You can use any resources you like to achieve this, including documentation, cunning, colleagues, guesswork, community or formal training. We recommend that you don't look at the solutions (if there are any!) until you have completed the challenge or are completely stuck. The best learning is done when you're pushing yourself!

We need new challenges to be added all of the time, in all of the available categories. If you have an idea for a challenge please write it up in a similar style to the existing challenges and submit a pull request against the repo. Your challenge will then be checked and integrated into the repo for others to try.
We also need early problem solvers. Some challenges may not yet have a solution, and here we need people to create those solutions and document them as a demo. Additionally, if you have a significantly different solution to the challenge, you may submit this as a pull request to be included with the challenge.

Scroll down for the list of available challenges.

## Solutions

Each challenge will include one or more solutions which explain how someone else completed the challenge previously. This is not necessarily the best or recommended solution, it's an example of one way to complete the challenge. Remember when looking at solutions that any valid solution will be accepted. It's possible to open a tin of beans with a rock - it's up to the reader to identify the best tin opener!
